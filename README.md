# Replication Package for: Forecasting Philippine Inflation with a Bayesian Markov-Switching Dynamic Factor Model

## June 2025

This replication package accompanies Osio, Julber (2025). "Forecasting Philippine Inflation with a Bayesian Markov-Switching Dynamic Factor Model." Term paper, Barcelona School of Economics.

## Abstract in English

I estimate a Bayesian two-stage model to forecast Philippine inflation over the second quarter of 2025. A dynamic factor model extracts latent macroeconomic drivers from a high-dimensional panel of monthly and quarterly variables, including a novel typhoon exposure index constructed from spatial wind field data. Inflation is modelled as a regime-switching linear function of the latent factor, with coefficients and variances that evolve according to a first-order Markov process. To improve short-term forecast accuracy, the regime model is estimated only on a post-break subsample, with the break identified endogenously based on smoothed inflation trends. Forecasts for April‚ÄìJune 2025 remain below 1.5%, tracking realised values where available. The model is implemented via Gibbs sampling and validated through rolling cross-validation, demonstrating strong short-horizon predictive performance.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

1. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Execute the pipeline**

   Simply run:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   This performs the entire process:
   - Loads and transforms the dataset
   - Estimates the dynamic factor model
   - Trains the Markov-switching regression on post-break inflation data
   - Forecasts inflation over 2025Q2
   - Evaluates forecast performance
   - Saves all plots and tables to

## üì¶ Requirements

See `requirements.txt`. The code runs on Python 3.8+ and uses:

- `pandas`, `numpy`
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`
- No proprietary packages

## üß† Model Overview

- **Stage 1: Dynamic Factor Model**
  - Bayesian estimation of a single latent factor summarising macroeconomic indicators
  - Factor model includes AR(1) dynamics
  - Implemented in `factors.py`

- **Stage 2: Regime-Switching Inflation Model**
  - Inflation depends on the latent factor via regime-specific linear equations
  - Regimes switch via a Markov process
  - Trained only on post-break period (identified endogenously)
  - Implemented in `ms_regression.py`
